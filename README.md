Amphtml is a universal solution to integrate the AMP Project (Accelerated Mobile Pages Project) into your Rails app with ease. It enables you to quickly spin-up, build and test your app with AMP, while fulfilling the app's unique requirements. It comes with a bunch of superpowers like user authentication, notifications, blogs, animations and support for assets in AMP.

Use the powerful features of AMP to make your Rails app consistently fast, beautiful and high-performing across devices and distribution platforms.

## Concept

## Features

## Installation

You can also follow the [**Getting Started Guide**](https://github.com/jonhue/amphtml/wiki/Getting-started).

AMP-HTML works with Rails 4.0 onwards. You can add it to your `Gemfile` with:

```ruby
gem 'amphtml'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install amphtml

If you always want to be up to date fetch the latest from GitHub in your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem 'amphtml', :git => 'https://github.com/jonhue/amphtml.git'
```

### Generators

Amphtml comes with three different generators. If you want to bundle them execute:

    $ rails g amphtml:bundle

That will generate all the files you need to create a universal AMP app (recommended).

If you want to use [SplitView](https://github.com/jonhue/amphtml/wiki/Docs:-SplitView) to create views with and without AMP simultaneously, execute instead:

    $ rails g amphtml:bundle --split

To add components ([List of components](https://github.com/jonhue/amphtml/blob/master/lib/amphtml/components/docs/README.md)) to the generator simply include the component as an option:

    $ rails g amphtml:bundle --analytics --notifications

You can also run the three generators independently:

    $ rails g amphtml:install
    $ rails g amphtml:helpers
    $ rails g amphtml:views

*Each* of them supports the `--split || -s` option to use **both** regular views and AMP views.
To add components, you need to pass them as option to the each generator.

### Test and validate AMP

Amphtml allows you to test and validate your views out of the box:

    $ amphtml test all

Pass `--split` as an option if you are using SplitView:

    $ amphtml test all --split

`test all` runs multiple tests to check if your code is valid. You can also run each test specifically.

To get a list of all tests and learn how to run them, go to [how to test and validate](https://github.com/jonhue/amphtml/wiki/Guides:-Test-and-validate)

To all tests (even `test all`) you can pass the option `--fix || -f` and Amphtml will suggest changes you could make. You can accept or reject them.
If you want to automatically fix the code, pass `--autofix || -af` as option. Be careful, you will not be asked to approve changes to the documents!

AMP has a validator built in. To validate:

    $ amphtml validate root # validates "http://localhost:3000"
    $ amphtml validate https://slooob.com # validates "https://slooob.com"

**Note:** `root` is only available as a parameter in development environment..
