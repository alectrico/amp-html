# AMP-HTML - Reliable and high-:zap: apps with AMP & Rails [IN DEVELOPMENT]

Amphtml is a universal solution to integrate your Rails app easily with the AMP Project (Acellerated Mobile Pages Project). It enables you to quickly spin-up, build and test your app with AMP, while fulfilling the app's unique requirements.

Use the powerful features of AMP to make your Rails app consistently fast, beautiful and high-performing across devices and distribution platforms.

## Concept

## Features

## Installation

You can also follow the [**Getting Started Guide**](https://github.com/jonhue/amphtml/wiki/Getting-started).

AMP-HTML works with Rails 4.0 onwards. You can add it to your `Gemfile` with:

```ruby
gem 'amphtml'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install amphtml

If you always want to be up to date fetch the latest from GitHub in your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem 'amphtml', :git => 'https://github.com/jonhue/amphtml.git'
```

### Generators

Amphtml comes with three different generators. If you want to bundle them execute:

    $ rails g amphtml:bundle

That will generate all the files you need to create a universal AMP app (recommended).

If you want to use [SplitView](https://github.com/jonhue/amphtml/wiki/SplitView) to create views with and without AMP simultaneously, execute instead:

    $ rails g amphtml:bundle --split

To add components ([List of components](https://github.com/jonhue/amphtml/wiki/Components)) to the generator simply include the component as an option:

    $ rails g amphtml:bundle --analytics --notifications

You can also run the three generators independently:

    $ rails g amphtml:install
    $ rails g amphtml:helpers
    $ rails g amphtml:views

*Each* of them supports the `--split || -s` option to use **both** regular views and AMP views.
To add components, you need to pass them as option to the `helpers` and `views` generators.

### Test and validate AMP

Amphtml allows you to test and validate your views out of the box:

    $ amphtml test all

Pass `--split` as an option if you are using SplitView:

    $ amphtml test all --split

`Test.all` runs multiple tests to check if your code is valid. You can also run each test specifically.

To get a list of all tests and learn how to run them, go to [How to test and validate](https://github.com/jonhue/amphtml/wiki/How-to-test-and-validate)

To all tests (even `test all`) you can pass the option `--fix || -f` and Amphtml will suggest changes you could make. You can accept or reject them.
If you want to automatically fix the code, pass `--autofix || -af` as option. Be careful, you will not be asked to approve changes to the documents!

AMP has a validator built in. To validate:

    $ amphtml validate root # validates "http://localhost:300"
    $ amphtml validate "https://slooob.com" # validates "https://slooob.com"

**Note:** `root` is only available as a parameter in development environment..
