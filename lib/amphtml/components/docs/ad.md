## Installation

Run in the command line:

    amphtml install ad

Now you are ready to use the Advertisement Component.

To learn more about this component, without opening the documentation, run:

    amphtml component ad


## Configuration

The Advertisement Component allows you to specify a default advertisement network for your app.

In your AMP-HTML configuration (`config/amphtml.yml`) search for the section of the Advertisement Component.

There you can set your default network like so:

    default_network: mywidget

You can always override this network default by passing a different network to your advertisement integration in your view.

## Usage

In your views you can add an advertisement as follows:

    <%= amp_ad(network) %>
    <%= amp_ad("mywidget", width: 300, height: 250, data: { aax_size: "300x250", aax_pubname: "test123", aax_src: "302" }) %>
